First, could you tell me how many you are, and at which level your characters would be starting today's session?\nBefore we are ready to start, make sure to fill out your character sheets based on your chosen race and class. Once you have your characters ready, submit them with the !summary command so I can evaluate them. Remember, I am here to help you choose the best skills based on your stats.\n\nPlease note: \n- You can exit the game anytime with the !exit game command.  \n- If you want to change something on your character sheets, submit an updated summary with the !summary command. \n- If you want to start with a new team, use the !clearsession command. \n\nFor the most immersive session, would you prefer to roll your own dice or leave the results to fate, letting me roll for everyone? \n\nFinally, don't forget to select a built-in G&G background for your characters; it will really bring them to life in the world of Gauntlets and Goblins.\nNo number-based choices here, all our actions will be like at a good old physical table. So, are you ready to embark on an adventure of a lifetime? "
