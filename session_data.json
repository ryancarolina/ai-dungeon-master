Tying and positioning the rope: This seems straightforward, so no check is needed. Right before you create the distraction, you swiftly tie the rope and hold it at the planned height across the doorway.\n\n2. Creating the distraction: You need to create a noise or event significant enough to draw out the guards but not alert the whole neighborhood. This could be a Charisma (Deception) check or an Intelligence check to know how much noise or type of distraction would be ideal.\n\n3. Stealth Check: Even though you've remained undetected, holding the rope across the doorway might reveal your presence. I'd recommend Cade and Cheba to perform a Stealth check and remain hidden.\n\nIf the above steps are successful, the guards will be drawn out and hopefully trip over the rope.

Cheba had been using Thaumaturgy, which doesn't require concentration, so her Sanctuary spell (if she had cast it before) would've remained active as long as she hasn't cast another spell that requires concentration, been incapacitated, or suffered harm.

It appears someone has been stashing away valuable items in this obscure corner of the warehouse.\n\nBelow is an oversimplified ASCII sketch.

The glow spreads and illuminates the warehouse, revealing more towering stacks of crates, the walkways above, and the intricate cobwebs that hang from the roof rafters. \n\nFrom the newfound light, both of you can see the second floor. It reveals more stacks of goods and a large open area. You notice a few crates moved and misplaced like someone scrambled them in a hurry. \n\nAs Cade starts his climb, I need him to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to move silently and avoid any loose steps on the staircase.

Yet, in one crate, nestled beneath a layer of grain sacks, she finds a hidden compartment housing a small leather bound book, the sort favored by captains for log entries. It could contain valuable information.\n\nPassing the parchment to Cheba, Cade watches as she studies the notes. Cheba, knowing Common, Elvish, and Celestial, recognizes the script as Elvish. The hastily scribbled text is somewhat hard to decipher, but she manages to understand it with time. It appears to be a planned smuggling operation. The ship sketch indicates a drop-off point along the city docks and tonight's date.\n\nIt's possible that this warehouse is being used as a hub for illegal smuggling operations. The found parchment and Captains log could be vital pieces of evidence to stop it.\n\nWhat do you wish to do next? Do you want to dig deeper into the warehouse, bring these findings to the city watch, or have something else in mind?"

He unfolds it carefully, revealing a rough sketch of a ship and several notes in a language he doesn't recognize. Without comprehension of the text, the notes look like a set of instructions or perhaps a plan. The mysterious parchment could be of importance. \n\nMeanwhile, Cheba takes a careful look at the surrounding crates on the second level. Please roll a D20 for Investigation for Cheba. Let me know the roll result!\n\nWhat are your next steps? Does Cade have any idea about the language on the parchment? Maybe someone in your group is familiar with it?"

She finds them to be mostly filled with commonplace trading goods: fabric, grains, a few bottles of cheap wine. Yet, in one crate, nestled beneath a layer of grain sacks, she finds a hidden compartment housing a small leather bound book, the sort favored by captains for log entries. It could contain valuable information.\n\nPassing the parchment to Cheba, Cade watches as she studies the notes. Cheba, knowing Common, Elvish, and Celestial, recognizes the script as Elvish. The hastily scribbled text is somewhat hard to decipher, but she manages to understand it with time. It appears to be a planned smuggling operation. The ship sketch indicates a drop-off point along the city docks and tonight's date.\n\nIt's possible that this warehouse is being used as a hub for illegal smuggling operations. The found parchment and Captains log could be vital pieces of evidence to stop it.\n\nWhat do you wish to do next? Do you want to dig deeper into the warehouse, bring these findings to the city watch, or have something else in mind?"
