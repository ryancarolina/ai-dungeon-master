In combat, each participant gets a turn in initiative order, and it was Cheba's turn before Cade's based on the initiative rolls.\n\nAlso, as the Dungeon Master, I should indeed roll for the opponents. Let's fix that.\n\nThe first goblin, snapping out of its disorientation, lunges back at Cade in retaliation. I will now refer to my dice to see if it manages to get past Cade's defenses. At the same time, the second and third goblin, recovering from their initial shock, charge towards Cheba.\n\nLet's see how these actions unfold."

Cheba, sandwiched between the two, raises her warhammer in defense. Yet, the goblins seem to be thrown off by the deafening chaos of crow sounds and their lack of coordination causes them to miss Cheba entirely.\n\nFinally, the fourth Goblin, from the back, hurls the rock towards you. It whizzes past your group, missing everyone, and clatters harmlessly to the ground, testament to the poor aim of the goblin.\n\nIt's back to Cheba and Cade. What are your next moves?"
